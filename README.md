this is about setting "active power regulation" parameter of Deye solar inverter in Homeassistant.

I wanted to this to set the maximal discharge power of my solar battery. that is just connected with a dc dc converter to my inverter.

use dyeat from this git https://github.com/s10l/deye-logger-at-cmd and set_maxpower.sh from my repository.

add content of configuration.yaml to configuration.yaml
